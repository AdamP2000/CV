Adam Phillips

Since September 2019 I have pursued a BA in Russian and Spanish at UCL; however, whilst I enjoyed my time, my interests lie in understanding the theoretical framework for languages, rather than the literature itself. As I delved further into this space, I realised that mathematics, a command of computer science and programming are requisite foundations. I have been following the progress being made within artificial intelligence (AI); in particular, the release of the autoregressive language model from OpenAI: GPT-3. Linguistics remains a passion of mine and discovering that there exists an algorithm capable of learning and then generating prose indistinguishable from human writing is captivating. This interest has driven me to teach myself programming, and I am hoping to enhance my knowledge by attending a coding bootcamp, Makers Academy, from February - April 2021, with a focus on backend development in Python, given Python is a popular language within machine learning.
