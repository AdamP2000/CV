Adam Phillips

Upon leaving Charterhouse, I pursued a BA in Russian and Spanish at UCL from September 2019 until November 2020; however, whilst I enjoyed my time, my interests lied in understanding the theoretical framework for languages, rather than the literature itself. As I delved further into this space, I realised that mathematics, a command of computer science and programming are requisite foundations. I have been following the progress being made within artificial intelligence (AI); in particular, the release of the autoregressive language model from OpenAI: GPT-3. Linguistics remains a passion of mine and discovering that there exists an algorithm capable of learning and then generating prose indistinguishable from human writing is captivating. This interest drove me to teach myself programming, and I enhanced my knowledge by attending a coding bootcamp, Makers Academy, from February - April 2021, with a focus on both front and backend development using Ruby and JavaScript with a big emphasis on testing. I am also a keen sportsman, and hope to one day marry my passion for sports with programming. I am certain as a software engineer, I will be well positioned to contribute effectively in a team.
